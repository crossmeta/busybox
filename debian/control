Section: utils
Description: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems. 
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.).  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install symlinks
 for any of the supported utilities.  You can use /bin/busybox --install
 to install BusyBox to the root directory (you do not want to do this
 to your your Debian system, except in dire emergencies!).

 BusyBox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell
 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox.  This package is
 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your
 system.  Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save
 your system from certain destruction.  Invoke "busybox", and it will list the
 available builtin commands.

 busybox-udeb is used by the debian-installer, so unless you are working
 on the debian-installer, this package is not for you.  Installing this 
 on your Debian system is a very, very bad idea.  You have been warned.
